        Just a copy of:

            https://github.com/lecram/gifenc

        With a slighly modified example file that works
        out of the box with a .SH build script. The idea 
        is that if you are new to C programming this project 
        will compile out of the box by just double clicking 
        the .SH script. If you cannot run .SH files, install  
        git bash for windows:
